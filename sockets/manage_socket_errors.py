If you try to get information about specific domains or
IP addresses that donâ€™t exist, it will probably throw a socket.gaierror exception, showing the
message [Errno -2] Name or service not known.

If the connection with our target is not possible, it will throw a socket.error exception with the message Connection error: [Errno 10061] No connection.
This message means the target machine actively refused its connection and communication cannot be established in the specified port, the port has been closed, or
the target is disconnected.
